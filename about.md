## About Me

I'm currently a Cloud Infrastructure engineer at Databricks working in San Francisco.
I previously worked at Cisco Meraki, where I worked on backend infrastructure, and in particular,
our custom time series relational database, [Little Table](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3056102).
Before that, I did my undergrad at Caltech in EE (with a minor in CS),
and did a quantitative finance & technology internship at Citadel while in school.

I enjoy all things science/technology/finance, and love to learn new things. I'm an big fan
of puzzles, both mathematical and engineering related. Currently, I'm spending more time
learning about infrastructure/cloud technologies (especially Kubernetes!), but I also enjoy most computer science
subjects (databases, compilers, systems, etc).

If you're interested in discussing problems, or tackling new projects, feel free to reach out!
