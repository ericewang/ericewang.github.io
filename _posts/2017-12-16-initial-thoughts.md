Wow the technology available with GitHub Pages and Jekyll sites significantly reduces the barrier to making a simple (yet elegant) website!
There was even less of an excuse for me to get started. Now I'm mostly done with the skeleton framework. Hopefully soon,
I'll try to think of something to actual write about, and be less meta.
